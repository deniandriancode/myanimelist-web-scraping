Enen no Shouboutai|https://myanimelist.net/anime/38671/Enen_no_Shouboutai|avedog100|https://myanimelist.net/profile/avedog100|Mixed Feelings|                      Not sure why they took away the categories but this is a pretty interesting one to say the least. Major pacing issues, characters being one dimensional and general rushed plot development really hold this one back. I feel as though many of the best arts are lost between the lack of a build up with satisfactory resolutions. Black Clover does this really well as things begin to unfold over time that create intrigue into the world and its characters where fire force just throws it at your face. Characters will blatantly tell the viewer everything they need to know without much respect for the viewer                   ... or their commitment to growing with the show.  Fire Force however does have great action sequences with that same Soul Eater flare for character design and abilities. The MC Shinra is quite likable but lacks the depth of someone worth rooting for and whos conflict isn't all that relatable. Other highlights would include the lore of the world which is mysterious and intriguing as well as how character relationships will develop moving forward.   Story: 6 Art: 7  Sound: 6 Character: 6 Enjoyment: 7 Overall: 6 |6
Paradise Kiss|https://myanimelist.net/anime/322/Paradise_Kiss|ayleewu2|https://myanimelist.net/profile/ayleewu2|Recommended|                      I haven't watched such a refreshing, down-to-earth, yet passionate anime in a long time. I will say that my review has slight bias since I'm a part of the audience demographic, older women. I'm going to dissect all the elements of the anime and attempt to give an objective review.   PLOT: 10/10 The story follows a high school girl named Yukari who studies and works diligently on college entrance exams. Due to her mother's pressure and expectations, she goes to an academically prestigious academy but gets wound up in an atelier where an eccentric group of fashion students, who make up the fashion brand "Paradise Kiss,"                   ... ask for her to be their model. Overall, the plot was incredibly unexpected -- a passionate and lustful romance, abuse, beauty, and queer identity. I loved every second of it. Immediately, as a fashion lover, I fell in love with the art and designs. I was always entertained, and no episode felt boring or unimportant. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I ultimately loved the ending and the unique feelings I got from watching the show. It's not the typical "hype" feeling of a shonen anime -- not by a long shot -- but it's feeling of skepticism, self reflection, passion, obsession, and independence. There's no action, and there's not that much drama in retrospect. It's the relationships among the characters that drive the character development and the plot. The character's flaws and the painful process of resolving emotional conflicts are some of the best and one-of-a-kind elements of Ai Yazawa's work.   CHARACTERS: 10/10 I loved every single character. Of course, I don't LOVE them. I just love how flawed, weak, and manipulative they are. This refreshing portrayal and undeterred determination to bring the ugly sides of each character to light is what makes me love this show. Yukari, for example, is extremely and obviously flawed from the very beginning. She's disrespectful, never takes accountability, and falls victim to lust and loss of innocence. However, her character development is one worth watching, and it's honesty quite empowering as a female viewer because these experiences and feelings are no stranger. I think these unique highlights of a cisgender woman's flaws are incredibly common -- falling in love too fast, being manipulated, obsessing... I loved seeing her deal with these dilemmas, and I highly recommend everyone, no matter your gender, to gain a common yet realistic perspective of Yukari's coming-of-age.   CONCLUSION: This show is not the "tragic love story" people make it out to be nor is it the dramatic and stereotypical melodrama you expect. It's simply life, a realistic and beautifully crafted story of a young woman growing up, learning to be independent, and finding happiness. I highly recommend to get out of your comfort zone and enjoy the ride. Whatever expectations you have for it, drop them. It's definitely a show that stands on its own. It's nothing like I've seen before. |10
Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou|https://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawai-sou|hexashadow13|https://myanimelist.net/profile/hexashadow13|Recommended|                      tl;dr: An anime with decent but slow moving relationship development in the main couple and really good comedy with a strangely likable cast of characters.  This anime is centered around the Kawai Complex, a boarding house that’s full of strange people, where a high school student named Usa starts living. Usa, is a great protagonist because he’s someone who’s able to empathize with people who are completely different from him. This results in him falling in love with fellow boarding house member Ritsu who is a major bookworm that seems to not want to have to deal with the stress of bonds and starts off the                   ... series spending most of her time alone just reading. However, Usa is good at giving her space and trying to form a connection with her in a way that accommodates her personality, so he manages to advance their relationship a decent amount, though at the point the anime ends it’s far from anywhere conclusive. To be clear, what’s interesting about this relationship isn’t that the two of them are similar in being strange and that they just manage to click, but rather that despite them being very different, because of how Usa makes an effort to try to understand Ritsu, he’s able to break her out of her shell somewhat and get her interested in him as well. It should be noted that although the relationship between the two is the only major overarching plot line it’s far from what the anime spends most of it’s time on.  The majority of the anime is just random hijinks with the cast of Kawai Complex and other people that they’ve come to know. Usa just wants to live a normal life and be normal, but he seems to be destined to keep getting involved with bizarre people, heavily in part because due to being able to empathize with them he’s good at dealing with them and thus they naturally try to form connections with him and he’s too nice to resist. And the end result of this is a never ending stream of hilarious situations. The comedy is well paced and has really good variety, having a solid core set of characters, but constantly throwing in various others to add more variety. Within that comedy, in addition to the overarching romantic plot with Usa and Ritus, there are also some minor smaller stories that are a bit more serious dealing with other characters, though for the most part they’re just kind of there as a set up and to give the comedy a better sense of structure which results in things flowing better. They do flesh out the characters somewhat, but there’s nothing like character arcs or anything like that.  Still, I think the cast is still worthy of praise because of how unique they are. The three main sources of comedy are the masochist author Shiro, the bitter about love office lady Mayumi, and the mischievous playgirl Sayaka. The three of them are always causing trouble, especially the latter two, which makes sense as their personalities are awful. They’re not people I would like to be friends with in real life probably. They’d probably come across as incredibly unlikable in most anime as well. However, with the way this anime frames things, structures things, and writes around things, it surprisingly makes them overall likable characters, which is pretty impressive. This is a risk because this is a fine line to walk and misses result in the comedy failing worse than usual, and there are some occurrences of that in the anime. But overall it is still worth it because the benefit of that is that with their personalities and roles in the anime, it results in really unique humor as well.  The art and animation on this are surprisingly good. The art style has a very unique feel to it which mostly just looks decently nice but can look really impressive at times, especially during heavily animated portions. The designs are mostly pretty basic, but the art style can make them look really impressive at times. The soundtrack was decent enough but not particularly impressive. The OP and ED are both have good visuals and songs that fit the anime really well. |8
Paprika|https://myanimelist.net/anime/1943/Paprika|DavidLara|https://myanimelist.net/profile/DavidLara|Recommended|                      This is by far one of the most interesting animes I've watched. it will make you have all types of reaction to it. From joy to straight fear and confusion (in a good way). Paprika has a very scary and cogitative premise. A new technology is developed in this utopic future, where people can have their dreams accessed by a device that can transmit even the most obscure thoughts into the real world. Something advanced like this can be very helpful but, dangerous at the same time. What happens is that someone is using this machine to kill people through their dreams, it's almost like                   ... the ones that are targeted can't differentiate what's real and what's not. So it's up to our main characters to find who's responsible for these murders. I was speechless by how everything falls into place. You'll feel like you're in there and everything is truly happening within your grasp. Nothing happens by mistake, everything has it's meaning, just pay attention to the enviroment, specially in the dreams itself. I truly recommend this one, specially for all the sci-fi fans out there. Already a classic. |10
Angel Densetsu|https://myanimelist.net/anime/5251/Angel_Densetsu|WhoCanPeliCan|https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhoCanPeliCan|Mixed Feelings|                      It's incredibly unfortunate that Norihiro Yagi's Angel Densetsu never got the praise and recognition that the author's next work, Claymore, got. I have a lot of love for the bloated, yet charming, manga that this is based off of, but the short length and low production values makes it hard to recommend the anime over just reading it. Some of the best material of this story is left completely unadapted in these 2 episodes, leaving a lot to be desired. While not terrible, the pacing leans on the slow side, further making it hard to recommend over the manga. I'd recommend it for anime watchers                   ... that don't like reading manga, but beyond that I think there isn't much to gain from this unless you're already a fan of the work and want to see what could have been. I hope this someday gets readapted in its entirety. |7
Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach|https://myanimelist.net/anime/1533/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach|jedemdasseine|https://myanimelist.net/profile/jedemdasseine|Recommended|                      What if you combine mahou shoujo anime and wedding theme with a lot of English named things? You will get Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach!  If I had one word to describe this anime, it would be "Pure". It is basically a trio of high school girls/magical girls fighting evil while being dressed as brides. A lot of school life, first love, hardships, monsters, saving the world - all the normal school stuff, nothing new here. There are a lot of comparisons with Sailor Moon - and yes, it is indeed correct (it uses almost same formula for villains and monsters of the week), Ai Tenshi                   ... resembles Sailor Moon a lot... and as you can guess it didn't work good for critical reception of this anime. Coming out in 1995, it were overshadowed by SM and in result not many people know about existence of Ai Tenshi. Me myself only found it while looking at old anime mag scans.   BUT! As I may say, Ai Tenshi is not worse than SM. In fact, it has own upsides. Wedding thematic is... well, novelty in mahou shoujo anime. Also, music is fantastic, OP/ED are really melodic and these songs as beautiful as heroines are. And watching this, you can really dive in 90s anime aesthetic. Characters develop strong bonds through story, and sometimes you wonder if they really could beat "the great big bad". And I would also like to praise monsters, uhh, I mean, demons designs - there are so many with various powers, appearances and even characters, that I wouldn't mind even them being one trick pony.   So overall it is good mahou shoujo anime. Would recommend if you like 90s and classic themes like humans vs. monsters, or angels vs. demons in this particular example. And if you are looking for more Sailor Moon like anime - this is a great one to watch! |8
91 Days|https://myanimelist.net/anime/32998/91_Days|Sque3k|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sque3k|Recommended|                      Do you want to be even more depressed, traumatized, and mentally unwell than you already are?  Then this is the perfect anime for you, friend.  In all seriousness, this one is pretty heavy. Lots of graphic violence, disturbing scenes, non-explicit sex scenes; it's quite the ride. The action is somewhat hard to follow at first, but there's a clear plot and the main characters are well-written. The story and main character are extremely interesting, and Angelo is such an intriguing specimen who hooked my attention from the very start and kept a firm grip until the end.  It also had a very good ending in my opinion,                   ... but as with every ending, I doubt everyone will be happy with it. However, it was wrapped up nicely and had a heavy melancholy feel to it which was very fitting for the theme of the show. |8
Colorful|https://myanimelist.net/anime/841/Colorful|stefxstefani|https://myanimelist.net/profile/stefxstefani|Recommended|                      I started my search skimming through the trashy animes that usually plague the pages of the MAL ecchi tag. And I ended it quite satisfied but perplexed. You see, it was to my understanding that fast-paced, over-the-top, almost YouTube Poop-esque comedy was something unique to the era of the world wide web. But here in front of me is an anime preceding the 2000s and its outlandish internet culture, that exhibits all of these characteristics. I am not so naïve as to say "Colorful is ahead of its time" but I believe it stands atop its contemporaries as what may have served as the inspiration                   ... for modern-day "meme-culture." It's a bit jarring seeing a lenny face and hearing memey audio-stutters in an anime from the 90s, to say the least. Despite some of its fast-forward humor, the anime seems to be ground in its era- pertaining to its peeping comedy (not that similarly perverse animes aren't released today). It is understandable as to why a woman may not find panty-gazing humor as funny as I do. Though unlike other ecchi anime, Colorful doesn't seek to justify or ignore its male characters sleazy activity; but to draw attention to it, satirize, and poke fun at the absurd lengths these men are willing to go to satisfy their voyeuristic urges. This is where much of the humor lies. Their panty-gazing exploits often result in them hurting and embarrassing themselves for the enjoyment of the audience. It wouldn't be very funny of the characters were simply to succeed in their sexual harassment. "Colorful's" art, music, and animation are equal parts amazing, its overall aesthetic stunning. The anime opens with a fucking ska song song and ends with an experimental French breakcore track. Spliced between segments of the anime are these MTV, magazine-esque montages. From beginning to end, its stylistic in a way that evokes the spirit of 90s rave and underground culture. It makes sense that an anime this unique and experimental was created by the studio responsible for animes like Boogiepop, Lain, and NieA.     Definitely worth the watch and one of my personal favorites as of now. |9
Made in Abyss: Retsujitsu no Ougonkyou|https://myanimelist.net/anime/41084/Made_in_Abyss__Retsujitsu_no_Ougonkyou|Weebston|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Weebston|RecommendedPreliminary
                
                                      (7/12 eps)
                                  |                      Made in Abyss is a Dark Fantasy show so ridiculously good, I'm almost convinced Tsukushi-sensei (the author) is an actual God amongst men, who possesses divine insight and creativity the likes of which no mortal can ever hope to attain. How a show can be so tremendously f*cked-up and dark, and yet remain so incredibly human and touching at the same time, is a mystery the likes of which I'll never truly be able to comprehend. Almost every single aspect of this show is great: the world, the characters, the plot, the voice actors, the music, the production value... It's so good, I can scarcely                   ... think of a single negative thing to say here, other than the fact that you have to be able to stomach some truly gut-wrenching stuff.  The only reason I would ever hold off on recommending this to anyone, is that once you've seen Made in Abyss, there is precious little in the anime world, and perhaps in all of fiction, that can ever hope to match it. This season, much like the first one, is an absolute masterpiece, and a must-watch for any anime fan.  So set forth, Cave Raider, into the depths of the Netherworld once more; for it is through the Abyss that we are connected. But remain wary - for there are horrors lurking in its bowels that us humans were never meant to discover. |9
Hibike! Euphonium 2|https://myanimelist.net/anime/31988/Hibike_Euphonium_2|Itkovian|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Itkovian|Not Recommended|                      It's one thing to queerbait me, but it's another thing to not only queerbait me, but do it twice, after switching from a love interest who had a developed and meaningful connection with the protagonist, to one who is basically just an impossible-to-read weirdo that no-one in their right mind would be in love with. Combine that with excessive focus on interpersonal drama between marginal characters with very little payoff or meaning, and a general lack of focus on what should be the crux of the anime - the craft of music itself - and what you get is a waste of time.  Looks great, though!               |4
Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen|https://myanimelist.net/anime/30901/Utawarerumono__Itsuwari_no_Kamen|Haihi|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Haihi|Recommended|                      If nothing else, at least consider checking out the games which the Utawarerumono anime has been adapted from. The games compared to the adaptation are so much more fleshed out and "complete" feeling. Though I still recommend the anime from season 1-3, if you truly want the Utawarerumono experience then please go play the games. Many reviewers are not wrong when they say that the anime can be a mess/rushed because it is true. There is simply too much material to be adapted into an anime that is limited by 20 minute episodes which makes many fans of the games undervalue the effort put into                   ... the anime. I myself believe that in conjunction with the games, the anime serves as a great portrayer due to the game's style as a visual novel, it at times cannot create a scene as beautifully as an anime can (I believe the anime portrays some scenes/moments much better than the games). So once again, I recommend watching the anime, but if you want the best experience then play the games. |8
Spy x Family|https://myanimelist.net/anime/50265/Spy_x_Family|Zanryu1337|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zanryu1337|Mixed Feelings|                      Story:		4 Animation:	9 Sound:		6 Characters:	6 Enjoyment:	5	  Total:		6  There is currently a trend for quite a while in Shonen Jump and its different distribution forms. And Spy x Family follows this trend to a tee. Instilling the mundane with the fantastical. Some other series also do this and this trend exponentially increased over the past few months.  To row back a bit: Spy x Family is a simple story about a spy who needs to get a functional family, with wife and child, for a mission which includes a school entry ceremony and other stuff related to that. His true target is one of the parents of his child's classmate. I personally have a                   ... huge grudge against this kind of contrivance in a story. While the anime, and manga, are a work of fiction, this scenario isn't plausible at all. The expected duration of the mission is 5 months and world peace is on the line. And sending a basically unknown child to school and hope for great academic success to gain access to the target is really far fetched and highly complicated. In a similar obtuse fashion is the family dynamic itself. It hinges on anticipation of the secrets present. The father is a spy, the mother is an assassin and the daughter can read minds; and nobody tells each other. The daughter, Anya, has a unique perspective in that regard as the solely knows about the secrets. Many comedic moments rely and that perspective alone, as Anya hears the thought and reacts to the stated thought, putting the other characters in a weirded out state.  And Anya's comedy and perspective is what this Anime holds afloat. In the middle section there are two episode halves who focus on a visit by the mothers brother who suspects their fraud marriage. But after getting easily drunk the same joke is used over and over and over again. So there are three adults in a room and most of them are drunk and/or weirded out by the others. This scene goes on for far too long and the status quo is barely changed in the aftermath. It primarily introduces us to new characters which don't return for the rest of the season.  As this review only covers the first 12 episodes it certainly shows that this series went for the long run from the beginning. And this shows in the adapted material. It only covers the first 17 chapters and there are many segments and even a complete episode full with filler as the current structure has no clear arc definitions. It feels incomplete and it shows. And while the bi-weekly release schedule allows for longer chapters, having over 60 chapters with no clear conclusion in sight doesn't spark confidence that the next season will have a proper ending. I mean this season ending was a filler episode.  Another problem this series has is the staleness of the cast. There is barely any change in any of them. They mostly act as they would any other day. There are some realizations like "I'm a good father after all." But those characteristics aren't shown in a comparable fashion. There isn't any strife for change either. As they all act upon each other. The spy father acts as a father but stays the same spy. The assassin mother acts as a mother but the assassin shines through. And the mind reading esper daughter reacts to the thoughts around her. This leads to a stale cast and it evidently is broken up by constantly introducing us to new characters. It even hinted towards new main characters in the family dynamic.  But this a general problem of the aforementioned trend of instilling the mundane with the fantastical. The seriousness the characters bring with their backstory doesn't allow any change for them or their overarching goals. And while the serious moments produce the comedy you can only create so much out of that.  Spy x Family comfortably lies within its trend zone. In that pattern it knows its strengths and plays them right. But the weaknesses gleam through the large cracks. That makes this anime as a nice watch with some funny bits. For now it has overlooked its weak parts and has to address them in future installments.  And while I adore the fluid action sequences given by Wit Studio they are few and far between. The sound is fine and nothing outstanding. |6
Black Jack (TV)|https://myanimelist.net/anime/2213/Black_Jack_TV|tacaloking|https://myanimelist.net/profile/tacaloking|Not Recommended|                      my ratings for this anime is a  4  this anime seems to more target making a black jack anime fore children and it could of done this and still be good but as being part of the black franchise i expected it to still focus on medical drama but it feels like it almost could care less about it and was forced to have it because of the franchise this left me lose all interest in it if this was not part of black jack this would be average and i would of enjoyed it a bit but i wanted the medical drama                   ... and for most episodes the medical stuff get two maybe four minutes on average so if this was the part you liked about the franchise this might fall painfully flat really it is best not to watch this as something part of the black jack franchise and just a average kids show with medical things thrown in and there are good number episodes were it is literally thrown in as black jack travels to a random place and a person gets hurt and now they that person needs a doctor to save there life on a plus if you wanted pinoko to get more time as this is trying to make something for children she gets large chunk of more time of her having fun the show really in general heavily focus on slice of life elements of the patient of the  day and fun things and nothing relating to medical issues because i guess they felt no child would be interested while i feel outside of making sure not to show the insides of people the structure needs little change to appeal to children  and something like  Black Jack: Futari no Kuroi Isha i feel is something plenty of children would find entertaining and not showing anything inappropriate for a child while staying true to the point of black jack focusing on medical issues and drama  while this  i feel like it just did not feel black jack could connect to children so basally hacked away mostly everything the franchise was about to make a black jack they feel would appeal to children while losing far to much of the franchises essence like i said as a kids show its fine but it just missing far to much of the focus of black jack for me not to consider it a bad black jack series |4
Joshiraku|https://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku|Ritinal|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ritinal|Recommended|                      In simple words, its a comedy show that goes on very wild conversations and tangents stringing along many gags and jokes with no true purpose besides seeing how convoluted things can get, in a good way. I started watching this from seeing random clips on YouTube and am happy I chose to watch it.   Things you won't get: - Conflict based narrative, or any real goal that characters strive towards - Character development (characters don't change over episodes really) - Serious or dramatic story beats - Sakuga more than 1 or 2 times  Things you will get: - Fast paced skits - Gags that talk about a wide range of topics that                   ... I can't even give a proper range to - Conversation that go in many different tangents and directions - general hilarity and absurdity  It has the conversational length of something like Monogatari, without any of the philosophical depth and in the package of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things. |7
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai|https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai|Ryker-|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ryker-|RecommendedPreliminary
                
                                      (6/13 eps)
                                  |                      Anime is a genre of cliches, from Isekai's to magical schools many tropes tend to bleed till they die. And while this a fault of the medium as whole it makes they genre as a whole very stale. But every now and then a new show comes along that changes something in the formula and shakes things up. Sometimes for the worst like SAO, but in the case of this show, for the better as well.        Bunny-girl senpai is a fascinating show to me as it manages to mix some of my favorite genres in different ways. A romance mixed with                   ... an almost mystery, it reminds me a lot of Bakemonogatari except more grounded and less ethereal. A somewhat simple romance story about some Highschooler's dealing with the weight of adulthood and finding relation in it. this is very tight-knit, ell written story with a very interesting premise and characters, at least in the first half. both the main characters play off each other very well and it its enjoyable to watch them on screen, which in the case of a romance story is very important. And personally my favorite part is the mystery of each episode of different, "syndromes" the characters have. These serve as almost amalgamations of a person insecurities and serve to bring the characters closer and the plot forward and it turns out to be very interesting and with the romance in the story is very fun to watch. This is where I see the Bakemonogatari influence the most but it's not a bad thing, both these shows are very different in their approach and have a very different identity.       This show is mainly a romance through and through and its avoidance(mostly) of the usual anime bullshit is very refreshing, in a medium so overstuffed with the same things many times over something that stands out in the crowd is exciting. |9
Yu☆Gi☆Oh! 5D's|https://myanimelist.net/anime/3972/Yu☆Gi☆Oh_5Ds|13o13|https://myanimelist.net/profile/13o13|Mixed FeelingsSpoiler|                      It's not my favourite yugioh series but I still really enjoyed it. These are my personal thoughts on the cast : - I think, in hindsight, that Yusei was a tad too perfect, in the sense where he basically won (almost) every duel and that he always seemed like the one who was in the right. He had no imperfections in his character so, I kinda wished he lost a proper duel ,at least once, to either Jack or Antinomy, so that he would have looked more "human". - I really liked Crow when I first saw him but when I rewatched the show years later, I                   ... found him annoying ngl. You can kinda see how he wasn't supposed to be a signer and how he was forced into a bigger role in the series. He wasn't a bad character but I do think that he should've have had less duels. - Aki was deserving of a better fate. She literally became a non factor after the dark signers arc, which is disappointing, because she was a really cool character with a good backstory ( I recommend watching MangaKamen on yt, he made a great video on her ). - Luna was sadly uninteresting to me. They didn't really try to make her the most impactful. I'm fine with Ruka's role and screen time. - Jack is my favourite. His personality was entertaining and his jap V.A. was awesome. He had a great character development and he was a good  first antagonist to yusei. I really enjoyed his moments with Carly, which is why I'll never forgive them for ruining their relationship by ignoring everything that happened between them following the dark signer arc (mostly by how the end of their duel was emotional). I don't know how it was so a hard to preserve their romance, above all how it wasn't the only mature part of the show. |7

                                      (7/12 eps)
                                  Spoiler|                      This show is one of my favorites.     Not for any really deep reason like I would like  to say, I generally believe that I enjoy more deeper, more interesting stories but every now and then a show comes along that you can really relate to and just enjoy. Senko-san is that a show for me.  A simple show about and overworked, unpaid white collar working in modern Japan who hate his life so much that he literally has a dark cloud above his head. This attracts the attention of Senko, who knows his ancestor to come into his life and brighten                   ... it up in hopes of making him happier. Now I find that these slice f life kind of shows can't be judged with the same lens that you would judge any other show because when you do they fall apart. they don't really have any plot or specific story that they follow. they don't seem very interesting and come off as very boring. But these kinds of shows have a different kind of enjoy ability, relating to the characters and feeling at home in their world. Senko-san has this kind of world where you can relate to its main character and feel yourself in his shoes, I know I did, going through similar things in life and maybe finding someone of your own that can pull you out of your literal, in this case, darkness.      This show is not very deep, the figurative "dark cloud" is about as deep as it goes, don't expect an Evangelion level of writing here, After all not all stories need this and in the case of this show its works. The very shallow stories supports the simplicity of the point, that overworking and loathing are horrible for everyone and can literally affect people around you, whether through how you act or treat people or as the show does it, a dark cloud corrupting everyone around the main character.       I find this show fascinating because I feel that is says a lot about Japan as a whole. Much anime, at least the well written shows, I find have a large connection to japan a a whole, they have such a unique culture with unique problems, its one of the things that drew me to anime it it comes out in interesting ways in some shows. Senko-san is one of these shows, on a shallow level I will admit, but in a simple way that I could relate to easily. Theire are shows like Evangelion and Shin Sekai Yori that you have to contemplate for a week to understand, not necessarily a bad thing but in my opinion it takes away from the point of a story when I have to look up a video on what the faq the ending of Evangelion meant. And I know I'm not the first judging by the millions of views the video has. Now this could be due to my very limited experience with the bible and related books, of which Evangelion takes HEAVY inspiration from but the point I am trying to make is that a simple theme that dosen't require me to read three books can go a long way in a story, and it works here, for me at least.      to wrap up this some what disconnected review, I like this show because it has a simple premise ad relatable characters, it doesn't need to be any more than that and I feel that some people tend to miss the point in these shows and misconstrue them, and I feel this how is one of those cases for many people. |9

                                  |                      Very educational. Even as a newcomer, I find it funny. And I learn too many inside jokes of the tales franchise, though I wish a lot of the tales games would be ported to steam. I don't mind my wallet crying in pain if it means gotta catch them all.   It's quite a fun watch to pass the time, and learning about the interesting and how vast the world is in all the Tales series, despite being only six of watch, is pretty cool. I also learned so much trivia like the seiyuus and the popularity polls in Japan.   But my problem is, where are                   ... the other episodes as I can only find six? I wanna see Yuri Lowell and learn more about the Tales Series. But when it comes to problems with production value, I think having the other characters be drawn in a traditional pencil-like way while the main characters are puppets, is kinda jarring. |6

                                      (6/12 eps)
                                  Spoiler|                      This show is charming. It has a good balance of fun and suspense. There's nothing groundbreaking about it, and it has it's issues, but for me it hits all the right notes.  The protagonist, Farma, is overpowered to the extreme, but he's entertaining to watch anyway. I'll have to admit, I'm a little too fond of overpowered characters. I get an absurd amount of satisfaction from watching someone do a huge spell while a shocked acquaintance cowers on the sidelines. The show does attempt to balance him a bit - he can be a bit clumsy and doesn't know everything (although in the context of the                   ... universe he might as well) - but for all intents and purposes he's kinda a Gary Stu. Farma is virtually a God in terms of his textbook knowledge of medicine, so his goal in the show, aside from making medicine accessible to the poor, is to learn the human aspects of medicine that you can only get from working directly with patients. It is incredibly wholesome. He is overpowered, but he gives you a warm feeling in your heart.  It's fun to get little tidbits of knowledge about pharmaceuticals. It's fun to see the little animations of chemical compound structures when he produces a new substance. It's fun to imagine what will happen when his close companions find out more about his past, and how that will affect the story. Farma's father is a great character. He's just a good role model and in general a fatherly badass.  As for what bothers me about the show...They take a lot of liberties with the setting. Farma is a walking modern medicine textbook living in a medieval world. His knowledge, if taken seriously, should by all means throw the entire economy into disorder. He cures tuberculosis in one day and just announces that it will cease to be a deadly disease. He creates a white face cream to replace lead-based face powder, and then gets the dangerous products banned. These cause some minor issues that get resolved pretty quickly - and that's totally unrealistic. But I get it, because realism is not what the show is about. The show is unrealistic enough that I think about it quite a bit, but in the end I put aside those thoughts because it's fun to watch anyway, and I am very invested in the characters. In addition, the cute little sister and the cute maid are kinda meh. I especially am not fond of the maid, I think she's annoying. But I think that's probably just personal preference.  All in all, if you like action/fantasy and heart-warming character development with a small side of science, this show is for you. |8

                                  Spoiler|                      This anime took like 3 episodes to convince me I should try and finish it before I was like okay I can keep watching this and enjoy it. I made it to the end of episode 6 and was like "hmmmm 6 more episodes?" Hard pass on that for me. Episode 6 felt like the end of a season to me. What they hinted at being in the following episodes is not my cup of tea.   I would recommend the first 6 episodes to anyone. However the last 6 I can't recommend because I haven't watched them for 1 and for 2 have 0 desire                   ... to watch them. If the writers could hint at the 2nd half being action packed and/or entertaining or basically anything aside from what they hinted at. I would take a stab at 7-12. But simply saying "I WILL find a way to kill this person that doesn't necessarily want to die, I have 0 reason to kill after she's literally saved my life and many others several times, rewound the world several times while still not going on a rampage as supposedly should've happened several times by now, AND I'm on good terms with...." yeah big fat NOPE from me.   Story wise, crap reason to continue the anime. Illogical, sounds boring, characters quirks already way overdone don't want to watch 2 more hours of the same. Also something to note, there is like 0 males in the anime. I mean for all the people tired of male main characters and males having ANY relevance or presence in the story, HERE. YOU. GO. Not going back to check but you have 2 males' names said like a total of 5 times added together and NO other males names even mentioned a single time. You also see them for about a total of 3-5 minutes combined. Everything else is ALL female characters.  Aside from all the negatives this anime had for me if I stick to simply just the 6 episodes I watched and ignore its crap lead into the next few episodes its not a bad anime. Like I said earlier, will be incredibly difficult to convince me to watch the remaining episodes of this anime but everyone should at least give the first 6 episodes a watch. |7
Totsukuni no Shoujo (2022)|https://myanimelist.net/anime/48405/Totsukuni_no_Shoujo_2022|Ritinal|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ritinal|Mixed Feelings|                      I scored this a 6  The question for if you will enjoy this small 3 episode OVA (wouldn't classify as a film per say) is: Do you like the poster art work and/or the trailer? If yes and your only expectation is good art, then you won't be disappointed. If no and you want something deeper, then you might not find it here.  The reason that I bench a lot of your enjoyment of this work on the art-style is that the overall story can be confusing to decipher and interpret. It does have a message and you will understand it and the themes present, but the                   ... in-between of getting to the smaller conclusions might have a lot of confusion mixed in that make it not as enjoyable to watch. Its like watching works that are really good at expressing concepts (March Comes In Like a Lion, Monogatari, Ranking of Kings) and having those expressions miss the mark.  What carried this show was the art-style and animation. Never disappointed when I hear unique art-style and Wit Studios in the same breath. Again, if you like the teaser or just the poster art for this and that is all you care about, you won't leave disappointed at the least. |6

                                  |                      「The Legendary anime」  I have watched various animes for many years, but I strongly believe that Gibiate goes down in anime history as being trash.  Overall, this anime is an outrageous work. I know that the production team wanted to make a zombie movie with samurai and ninja for foreign audiences, but the quality of the drawing is quite low. The battle scene lacks edge, the story is a parade of retrospections and long battle scenes to make up for the length of the episodes. In addition, the story is opportunism. With the blend of these terrible elements, Gibiate became famous as a ridiculous piece of crap                   ... in Japan.  If you watch this anime seriously, you'll lose. Gibiate is a just gag anime. There are many scenes you'll laugh at because there are many chaotic, unnatural, and stupid scenes. I recommend that you watch Gibiate, looking for odd scenes. This is the only way to enjoy watching this anime. If you can do it, you are one of us ーー Alliance of bad anime loves. (In Japan, some fans love bad anime like Gibiate. ) I want you to watch one episode to try it out. You'd be surprised how well the characters understand the situation that Sensui and Kenroku come from the Edo period.   It is also worth noting that cutlet curry won first place in an unofficial character popularity contest.  Congratulations! |1

I get the feeling this was the point of the anime being made so, if you're here for more than that then you might be dissappointed. However, there is still some substance to it. They don't completely cop out and there's some decent humanisation in there behind the unlimited bank account.   The two main characters have to learn to accept how and why the other one does police work their way, and in the process they come to trust and respect eachother enough to use eachothers strengths and methods.   Overall,                   ... I enjoyed it. |8

                                  |                      I've only seen 11 episodes and the last thing this mediocre-at-best padded-to-hell kids show needed was a dumbass screaming his head off all the time. I thought this was called Demon Slayer not Screaming Slayer.  How the fuck is that annoying yellow idiot one of the most popular characters? Why does every shounen protagonist need to have a stupid best friend? Can people not enjoy their anime without forced "comic relief"?  Showing Tanjiro trapped in a creepy mansion completely controlled by a demon, then cutting to this moron yelling with his eye-bugging out just ruins the tension and atmosphere.  This show doesn't need "comedy"                   ... and it doesn't need all this padding. Seriously, it's episode 11 and the plot has almost completely halted in favor of Naruto-filler-esque episodic stuff. A bird tells Tanjiro to go to random place, he goes and meets random people terrorized by demons, he and Nezuko kill them and take off, the bird tells him to go to new random place, rinse and repeat.  It wouldn't be so bad if the characters were interesting, but the only one I care about is Nezuko, and even she's just a typical moe-bait waifu. I'm curious about Shinobu (more moe-bait), but I can't stand that lemon-colored coward for a moment longer to get to the episode she appears in. Adding in Zenitsu was like letting another person climb onto a boat barely being kept afloat. I can't see myself being able to stomach a whole 26 episodes worth of this crap. |1
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann|thestarsailor|https://myanimelist.net/profile/thestarsailor|Recommended|                      Gurren Lagann is an absolutely over-the-top anime that basically tells the same story about four times in an increasingly large and universe-spanning manner, with an ending that will make you want to "row, row, fight the powah!" I've heard this called the mecha anime that is one big response to Neon Genesis Evangelion as having a more optimistic look into its story and characters and I definitely agree and thinks it lives up to the comparison. With all the massive explosions, great fights, and exciting music, there's one big theme of overcoming the odds, evolving, and securing freedom to enjoy tomorrow. The ending isn't quite                   ... a ride off into the sunset, but shows the main cast succeeded in making their mark and allowing new ideas to come forward. It's a hell of a ride and every episode is always ramping itself up with higher stakes and made we want to keep watching. Also, there are some songs from this anime that got famous and are used as memes, but the best ones are from the OP which is an absolute favorite of mine, and the one used for the ad bumpers in the middle accompanied by cool artwork. Some of the characters seem a bit simplistic to me, and it can follow the same formula, but it does keep moving upwards, like a drill. |8
Akuma no Riddle|https://myanimelist.net/anime/19429/Akuma_no_Riddle|ponpokorin|https://myanimelist.net/profile/ponpokorin|Not Recommended|                      If I had to sum this anime up in two words, it would be cringey nonsense.   The plot is about as contrived and nonsensical as it gets. It's about 12 assassins who are assigned to a classroom with one "normal" girl, who they're supposed to find and kill. That make much sense to you? Me neither. And the ending very much comes across as "I didn't know how to justify the absurd story so this is some bullshit I came up with". It tries to play it off as a plot twist, but the story and the characters are so poorly written, the audience probably                   ... isn't invested enough for it to work.   There are too many characters, and each with her own shoddy backstory that's supposed to somehow explain her shoddy motivations. These backstories are both wholly uninteresting and increasingly ridiculous. Although, the problem isn't really that there are too many characters, because even the leads are horribly underdeveloped stock characters stuck repeating the same shoddy lines over and over again. One has about as much personality as unseasoned chicken and never changes whatsoever, except when the plot demands that she does; the other is a paragon of unconditional friendliness and virtue, which, in the scenario of this anime, means that she comes across as the dumbest person alive.   Also, if you're here for the GL tag, leave. It isn't really GL. More queerbait than anything. The only blatant romance is between the girl who looks like a 30 year old pirate and the girl who looks like an elementary schooler. Of course.   *Very minor spoilers*  There is no tension throughout the course of the anime because the episodic style makes it abundantly obvious nothing will happen to our leads until the end. And even then, nothing happens. For a show that acts dark and edgy, I was pretty amused by the happy nonsense ending. It might as well have never happened.  Anyway, don't watch this show unless you want something you can cringe at a couple times and then completely forget within a week. |3

The animation is phenomenal which makes it shocking to me this came out 2 years ago. They also nail the English dubbing! It literally made get cry twice.  If you like or love romance anime then you should totally give this a shot. Warning!: It gets a little depressing near the last chunk of the movie!)It may be a little on the nose and melodramatic for some people but I loved it. I can also see people viewing it as formulaic but in my opinion I think that works to the                   ... films advantage and keeps the story simple and easy to follow. |9

Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun|https://myanimelist.net/anime/2494/Goshuushou-sama_Ninomiya-kun|hexashadow13|https://myanimelist.net/profile/hexashadow13|Mixed Feelings|                      tl;dr: An anime that has a plot that hasn’t aged all that well but may feel somewhat nostalgic, though the comedy still holds up decently well.  This is an anime from 2007. That probably isn’t that old for some people, but is about the time I got into anime so I’m somewhat nostalgic for anime from the time. This very much felt like an anime from back then. Not just in terms of the art style and animation, but also in terms of the story and characters. It’s an incredibly generic anime for back then, but the tropes and such that it uses have actually fallen                   ... out of favor so they’re actually not used all that much recently.  The protagonist, Shungo, a high school student who lives only with his older sister as his parents are off on a trip to who knows where and are never seen the entire anime. His sister is a mercenary who makes him go through ridiculous training making him an incredibly powerful fighter, but that almost never matters. The first love interest, Mayu, is an airheaded succubus who has androphobia and is relying on Shungo to help her get over it. The second is an incredibly competent tsundere ojou-sama who has an army of attendants at her beck and call. Also, one of these two may be his childhood friend since Shungo keeps having dreams about there being someone he made a promise to, but he seems to have forgotten who. And of course Shungo is completely dense and has absolutely no personality outside of being nice. Also, loads of utterly ridiculous stuff happens, such as random death matches, aliens, highly maneuverable fighter jets, ninjas, etc. Throw in all the other standard stuff such as a beach episode, hot spring episode, boys trying to sneak into the girls room on a field trip, accidental grabbing and kissing, etc. too. Just go down the checklist and hit pretty much everything.  The anime certainly isn’t incredible, but I enjoyed it as a throwback. The serious drama parts definitely haven’t aged well, though I guess they do have some charm. The comedy on the other hand I think has aged pretty well and overall the show is pretty funny when it’s trying to be. The anime also throws in purely comedic shorts unrelated to the main episode before the OP which I thought worked pretty well. I think I would have preferred for the serious parts during the main episode to take themselves less seriously and be funny as well, but the overall balance is decent enough though the pacing feels really slow during extended serious portions such as the finale. The finale is solid enough I suppose, if essentially completely predictable. I would also like to note that despite it being tagged as such, this isn’t a harem series as far as I understand the term. The protagonist only has two love interests. Of the other four girls in the poster, one I suppose teases him but it doesn’t seem like romantic development at all. The other three end up pairing off with other male characters and aren’t interested in the protagonist romantically.  The art, animation, and designs, are in the style of anime from the late 20s, and are decent for then though not especially high quality. The same applies to the soundtrack, which is decent enough but not particularly memorable outside of a track that’s used for flashbacks and such. The OP and ED are both pretty solid in terms of the visuals and song. The eye catches are decent as well and remind me a lot of VNs from back then. |7

I don't like romance books, movies, anime or anything related to romance. However, for me this anime is great. The MC is a little on the weaker side for my taste instead of the OP side but it still amazing and the romance aspect hasn't taken away from my enjoyment of the anime thus far.

Sword Art Online|https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online|Hugful|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hugful|Recommended|                      The foundation of this anime is the concept that is behind the new technology, VRMMORPG. And the best part, these people gets trapped in a VR game where if you die, you die in real life too. Interesting concept, right? Well that's not even close to what this anime is about. When one watches this anime with questions in mind like: "What can I take away from this anime", or "What is the meaning of this story", they can't help but to be disappointed because these questions are hardly ever answered throughout the anime. Yet this anime was timeless to many people. I watched this                   ... anime two years after started airing, in 2014, and I did so again in late 2022, the time of me writing this review. This anime is fast-pace yet at the same time a compelling, emotional, and timeless work of art.   - Story (Arc 1): Arc 1 covers episode 1-15. The concept of this anime was something entirely new to people back in 2012. The idea that you could die in a Virtual Reality MMORPG and in real life simultaneously was very intriguing. There is so much that the writer can do with this concept, when this VR/deep drive technology can take one person to an entirely new world and experience it as if they are in real life. And so embarks the adventure of our male MC, Kirito, he gets doesn't get much character introduction and backstory and we just jump into the world of SAO, and he just starts slaying shit, the further you go with this anime, the more you realize that Kirito is the anime protagonist we all wanted to be when we were 12-year-olds. I do not wish to spoil the story so this is as far as I will go with it. The only dissatisfaction I have for the story is that it moves too fast, I would have enjoyed it more if it had more in-depth character developments.   - Story (Arc 2): Arc 2 is the rest of the season. I do not have anything positive to say for this Arc, it had minor character developments and mostly stuff that all viewers will expect to happen. The content is built on a new game and concept that makes it fly as well as some romance that happens between some relatives. All because a villain wanted to marry a 17-year old. The only thing to look forward to in this arc was the ending of it, which was very satisfying.      -- First Arc had good story but second was a little worse in comparison. I would give them a combined 7/10.  - Characters: For the purpose of this review I will just talk about the male and female MC and a little bit about the sides. - Kirito: The backstory of this character was not displayed in the beginning of this anime, instead all the viewer sees is how this homie gets all the girls in this anime. And he is also very OP. This character alone would make this anime similar to other boring Isekai animes that come out every year. But God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone..."  - Asuna is the female MC, if one is to carefully evaluate this character, they will find that she holds virtues that are unique from all the other females that fell for Kirito. Asuna x Kirito is probably the most attention and tear drawing part of this anime, and it is a huge carry for the story being rushed because it doesn't matter. All the viewers care about at that point is to see Kirito and Asuna being happy together.       - Side Characters: They are responsible for some goofy side stories and also quite significant MC character developments. Their backstories were not very well unfolded because of how fast-pace the story went but they are still some cool mfs.   -- With all of them combined, I would rate character design 7/10.       - Art: The art was excellent for 2012 and still quite respectable after a decade. It had some pretty nice illustrations and effects that made it look futuristic and corresponding to the story. 8/10  - Music: This is one of the most influencing factors that make this anime emotional ride. Just go watch the anime yourself and find out for yourself. 10/10.  - Conclusion: With the rushed plot, interesting character interactions, decent art, and wonderful music, it becomes a very well produced shitpost that is simply difficult to enjoy if you are looking an anime that is deep or intelligent. But it didn't stop it from being extremely compelling. That's what this anime is about, not how crazy the concept of VRMMORPG evolves into or what true meaning this anime carries, but the relationships, adventures, and romance that forms with these characters trapped in this world that is now their reality. Their new home, Sword Art Online. |9
Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. 2nd Season|https://myanimelist.net/anime/50631/Komi-san_wa_Comyushou_desu_2nd_Season|Kuyosakee|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kuyosakee|Mixed FeelingsSpoiler|                      Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu suffers, and probably will suffer even more the further it continues, from one dimensional characters. Unfortunately, that is given since the plot point is for Komi to make 100 friends. But the thing that irks me more is that in the hierarchy of screentime, the author decided to give a great amount of it to an unbelievably awful and disgusting characters such as Yamai. I cannot even fathom how onesided the ratio of screentime to usefulness to the plot is. In this danganronpa-like slice of life, she acts like a final boss of all the train perverts and rapists your favorite                   ... hentai warned you about. How does sexual harrasment AND regular harassment help the story? Answer: it does not.  I also hate how they managed their resources this season. About 3 penultimate episodes looked like someones homework for an animation school just so that we can have an eraser shooting match with the quality akin to the first season of One Punch Man... Excuse me? |5
Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari|https://myanimelist.net/anime/35790/Tate_no_Yuusha_no_Nariagari|ggultra2764|https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764|Recommended|                      Rising of the Shield Hero is the latest popular isekai title making waves and one that actually offers some worthwhile storytelling potential. A young man named Naofumi Iwatani and three others are warped into a medieval-like parallel world where each gain possession of one of four legendary weapons that they must learn to wield to combat hordes of interdimensional monsters called Waves. Armed with the Legendary Shield, Naofumi finds himself on a unlucky streak as the kingdom of Melromarc doesn’t provide him with allies to aid in his adventure and he gets framed by the kingdom’s princess who falsely accuses him of raping her. Untrusting                   ... and cynical of the kingdom’s royalty and citizens due to their prejudice, Naofumi purchases a demi-human named Raphtalia from a slave trader and raises her to fight on his behalf, as both attempt to improve their abilities to fight the Waves and deal with the kingdom’s attempts to sabotage their efforts.   I’ll admit before seeing Shield Hero, I had been tiring of isekai anime due to oversaturation and anime studios not seeming to make much effort at offering up anything engaging for many titles they hammer out. With this series though, there is a solid amount of deconstruction it does to buck a number of the typical storytelling cliches offered up from recent isekai titles. While Naofumi is summoned as a “chosen one” to help protect a parallel world, he has to deal with the corruption of the kingdom’s royalty attempting to hinder his efforts to perform his duties as said “chosen one” and the cynical streak this leads him on becomes a source of character development where he has to get over said negative attitude to earn the respect of the parallel world’s inhabitants and earn their respect. The other three heroes also get deconstructed as they believe their adventuring is comparable to role-playing games they play, yet their inexperience with actual combat gets them in trouble dealing with major threats and their attempts at heroic deeds cause more trouble to those they aid due to not considering potential ramifications that could effect nearby inhabitants. In comparison, Naofumi takes the time to explore his surroundings to better understand the parallel world and strategize against potential threats. There are other elements of Shield Hero’s story and characters that get deconstructed throughout its run, but will leave folks to see how these play out if they have interest in watching it.  Outside of deconstruction, Shield Hero also offers up a solid foundation for world building, as well as story and character development. While having RPG elements with characters leveling up as they gain battle experience and buying or finding rare items and weapons, the series also takes time to explore the problems within Melromarc with the corruption of the royalty and church, as well as the prejudice and slavery faced by demi-humans within the kingdom. Outside of Naofumi and the three other Heroes  dealing with their ordeals in Melromarc, Shield Hero also explores the developments of several other relevant characters who are fleshed out in exploring how the Waves and/or Melromarc’s problems impact them, and each undergo varying degrees of development throughout the series. The story also dabbles more into the intentions of Melromarc’s royalty and church as episodes progress, while also providing some foreshadowing concerning the true nature of the Waves that have to be fought. The latter element is left unresolved as the series would continue into a second season for its anime adaptation and has a third season currently in development.   In short, I admit I was surprisingly engaged to Rising of the Shield Hero in spite of what issues I have with many recent titles within the isekai genre. The series offers up effective deconstructions of typical cliches of the genre, while also having a solid foundation for world building, storytelling, and character development with the ordeals faced by Naofumi and his party. In spite of hearing about the rather rough reception many had with Shield Hero’s second season, I am at least still interested enough in the series where I’d like to continue viewing it whenever I have a chance. |8
Inu-Ou|https://myanimelist.net/anime/39938/Inu-Ou|beargolfer|https://myanimelist.net/profile/beargolfer|Mixed Feelings|                      Just saw this in theaters, and I'm not sure if I can call this good or not. I won't make this horribly long, just sharing the vibes of it.  First off, I cannot understate just how fantastic this film was from an artistic standpoint. Whenever there's a music number (that's right babey, this is a musical), I was absolutely entranced. Mirai Moriyama and Avu-chan absolutely killed it, their performances sucked me into this underdeveloped story more than they should have. Side note, I think it's hilarious that the professional dancer voices the singer character and vice versa? The animation and choreography had the messiness that Yuasa                   ... is known for, and it worked perfectly for the rock-inspired songs. I was a bit frustrated when scenes reused the same piece of animation four times in a row, but that's my only major gripe visually.  "Why is this a 6/10 then? " Well, you see, the story was barely there. I felt as if it needed more time to show us the main characters were friends, to show us how much time had passed outside of "this character's hair grew". Everything just went so fast and I walked out of the theater feeling empty, wishing that there were maybe 15 more minutes and maybe a different ending.  I would never call this film good, honestly, but it was a damn fun time and I don't regret seeing it. If you're not too hung up on a film having a loose/unsatisfying plot and just want to see some crazy Queen-esque songs with cool animation? Go for it. |6
Violet Evergarden|https://myanimelist.net/anime/33352/Violet_Evergarden|Sirus739|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sirus739|Mixed Feelings|                      Sigh, So this is a very beloved show, wich is reflected by the score. Unfortunately i don't really agree with the majority here, so let's just get into it.   Story (7/10):  The story is not that bad, it was actually really engaging at the start. Unfortunately it didn't stay that way. The backstory of violet should have been handled differently, maybe a bit slower so we could be able to get to know the major besides him fuzzing over his regret of using a child-soldier. I think that that could be a way to make the inevitable moment at wich violet finds out about his                   ... death a tad more hard-hitting than it was. Also, what i mentioned before keeps getting shown throughout the show and it gets really irritating after a while, I legit just skipped trough the flashback scene's or anything that had to do with the major because it was just not interesting in the slightest. So why did i give the story a 7 you ask? Well the show is episodic throughout most of it's runtime, wich really works for this type of concept. It just focuses on whatever client violet has in the given episode, this works because you see all kinds of stories about people and their problems. Sometimes Violet even learns something from it herself only for that development to get thrown out of the window in the following episode but let's just not open that can of worms shall we?  Overall the story's main plot is not very good, but the side stories make up for it and is what this show should have been like throughout its entire runtime. Speaking of wich, this show would have been more fun if it had more episodes with Violet handeling jobs and sprinkling the stuff with the major through the story a bit more and maybe give him a bit more character for the love of god.   Art (10/10): It's good. You would be hard pressed to find any ugly shots in this show.  Sound (7/10): The ost is quite good, everything fits the tone perfectly and even improves upon it from time to time.   Characters (6.5/10):  The characters are mostly good, the side-characters have a nice, little arc in their respective episode and are usually very likable.   Violet works. She just works, nothing more. She has a borderline crazy obsession with the major who got her as a "present" from his brother, even when she makes new friends everywhere and gets a new job that she seems to love, she just forgets all about that all once she hears that her precious major died, telling herself that there is no point anymore or something along those lines. She literally tries to kill herself but can't for some reason, her hands just don't work on her throat or something :/   If I didn't make it clear in the story segment yet, the major is really bad. If he really didn't want to use her as a weapon and wanted violet to grow up normally why didn't he just make it happen? He could have left her at a child's home or leave her at his own darn mansion with his parents but he just doesn't for some reason.  The characters are overall not awful or anything, but they are certainly nothing special.  Enjoyment (5/10): Like i said, the first 7 episodes were good and then it just fell off, ep 10 is an exception. That episode was probably the best this show had to offer, though I personally liked ep 6 the best. It was fun at first, until it wasn't.  Overall (7/10): Violet Evergarden is a show with great art and music, a relatively decent story and some fun characters here and there. I would recommend watching it, even if it was just for the first 7 episodes. The thing i took away from this one is that your feelings might sometimes be easier to convey with a letter (although we rarely use letters these days).  Thank you for your time,  ~Sirus |6

                                      (7/12 eps)
                                  |                      If you're here for a good fantasy with a good story and great characters to match, then you are very lost. Mild spoilers near the end.   Story: What little there is of it is boring. The issue here is that there's really no overarching event happening with the characters taking part, but the characters themselves are creating the situations for other characters (side characters are causing problems for MC/bulling MC, etc.). While this isn't inherently bad, the characters in this show are painfully generic, which leads this style of storytelling to fail hard.   Art: Pretty good. The only reason this isn't a 1/10.  Characters: Generic pussy                   ... MC who is super strong, yet is bullied because the plot sucks. Generic childhood tsundere friend, except the tsun is ramped up to 11 so she just acts like a bitch to the MC the entire time. Generic onee-san character who is absolutely overpowered and yet will be weak randomly for plot convenience. On top of that, the onee-san wears either a virgin killer sweater or nothing at all for the entirety of the first 6 episodes. Even after the school decides to give her a student uniform, she doesn't button it up fully so her tits still stick out, reinforcing the fact that she is nothing but a fan service character.  Also the first (and only so far) villain is just comically evil. They didn't even bother to give him motivation to be evil, yet they had to have a generic villain so they made one. I'll assume the next few villains will also have 0 motivation and just be evil for evil's sake.   But is it enjoyable? Not really.   Even with all those issues, it still probably could have been just one of those shows you can turn your brain off and enjoy both the fighting and fanservice scenes. However, there is too much of a focus on the unnecessarily large cast of side characters, and those scenes are so boring that turning your brain off and just looking at them without thinking about what's happening isn't enough to make them watchable.   And the final nail of the coffin, and the mild spoiler, is that after a few episodes the show tries to be too serious for its own good. Around episode 5, the comically evil villain is introduced and tries to turn the kids of the school into demons and steal the demon onee-chan from the MC. Granted these scenes are separated by quite a bit of fanservice, it is an ecchi after all, but this temporary tone change is completely jarring and easily throws off anyone watching for a light-hearted, brain off show.   One last minor critique is that this ecchi is PG-13, meaning you don't get anywhere near the explicitness of the fanservice scenes as you would with most other ecchi. It's a minor issue, but the fact that the onee-chan was completely naked for multiple episodes yet there's never a solid, full on tit shot due to censoring means that even the fanservice of a show with nothing else going for it isn't very good. |3
Kotarou wa Hitorigurashi|https://myanimelist.net/anime/49909/Kotarou_wa_Hitorigurashi|VITO409|https://myanimelist.net/profile/VITO409|RecommendedSpoiler|                      Hello, call me Vito, and this is my first rewiew.  This anime is simply fantastic, every moment new things are presented and every action makes you rethink your actions. It's amazing how a simple 4 year old kid can change us so much. In addition, the anime not only brings Kotaro to the story, but also deals with real-life issues of an adult, Karino's creative block, or Mizuki's abusive relationship, or even the abrupt relationship between Tamaru and his son, and of course the main. Absent parents, or parents who don't take care of their children, and all the traumas that this can bring to a                   ... child. The anime is more than funny, it's a lesson, not for Kotaro, not for Karino, but for us. |10

Chicken Papa|https://myanimelist.net/anime/33859/Chicken_Papa|Melloow|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Melloow|Recommended|                      Chicken Papa is truly ingenious. In the beginning, a woman waits for an elevator to arrive to her floor. This represents how the people of our generation continue to wait for something convenient to help them even at the expense of others. When she gets into the elevator, the woman presses for floor nine. It is only one floor away from the maximum amount of floors this elevator can carry her. This is outrageously inconsiderate of her sense she doesn't say a word and acts as if it is normal for the elevator to do a human's bidding.   The elevator doors are closing... but abnormity                   ... strikes as Chicken Papa (a human sized chicken) walks into the elevator and politely says he gets off on floor ten. The woman presses the button, of course, but immediately looks away from Chicken Papa. She doesn't want to admit to her sins of pushing around technology. The scene also foreshadows a later part of this masterpiece.   Chicken Papa comments on the fact that she probably ate garlic chicken the other day. The woman immediately tries to act as if she never heard what he said by saying "pardon", but Chicken Papa knows she heard. She then apologizes quickly to him and looks back into the corner of the elevator as before. She is ashamed of herself, for she has been confronted by the very thing she thought was supposed to be doing as she would like. There is a moments silence...  Chicken Papa begins to cluck rapidly and the screen fades to white. This part is up for interpretation. The common belief is that the woman is imagining Chicken Papa and he is not even real. All Chicken Papa is is a figment of her imagination, the part of her brain that admits eating chickens without their permission is wrong, the side of her brain that admits making a elevator (which could easily kill her) do her bidding is wrong and shameful, and the side of her brain that wants to say she is sorry. At the end of the day, she went on with her disgusting life as a chicken abuser and elevator dictator.  Sound:10 Art:10 Characters:10 Voice Acting:10 Story:11 Overall: 51/50  This anime is really the greatest of all time. |10
Inuyashiki|https://myanimelist.net/anime/34542/Inuyashiki|lilnarkio|https://myanimelist.net/profile/lilnarkio|Mixed FeelingsSpoiler|                      Inyuashiki is like if superman and bizzaro were in an anime but superman was an old man and bizzaro was a teenage serial killer  plot-Inuyashiki is like an anime that felt all over the place, even though its only like 11 eps it packs a lot of stuff in just these eps we are first introduced to old man main character Mr.Inuyashiki that lives a pretty sad life no one loves him not even really his family or wife and he has 3 months to live before he dies of cancer and questions if they would even care. Which they prob wouldnt considering how they treated                   ... him. He then cries abt it at a park and gets blown up by some alienated thing and becomes some super machine along side some other teenager. This teen turns out to be Hiro the other main character who uses his new gifts to go out and kill people for no reason, they never really gave him a decent backstory on why he was crazy just some context of him seeing a dude kill himself gave him light and then how he feels alive killing people but midway through the series he stays at a classmates house that confessed to him grew close to her and wanted to live with her forever cause she told him so told him to start saving people then he gets targeted again and she almost dies but instead of turning himself in or running away, bro just goes on a rampage by killing the police force, and killing everyone in japan like what. Anyways Inuyashiki does the exact opposite by saving people we even get an ep where he saved some chick from getting r**ed by some yakuzu dude and he saves her and paralyzes the entire gang a very random episode but wholesome served not purpose to the plot. Anyways it kinda shows the contrast between these two characters until they finally clash in ep 10 but the weird part abt the show is that Hiros morals always confused me like he started just randomly killing people and then after he talked to his mom about the killer and wanted to take care of her he wanted to stop killing, though once she killed herself he started going crazy again, found someone else to care about and started to help people she got hurt thought it was a good idea to start killing again so they could be together once again like wtf bruh. Then in ep 10 when they fight and hiro loses or wtv, we find out some metor that was mentioned earlier just shows up out of nowhere and will destory the earth but the only way to save everyone is for both hiro and inuyashiki to self destruct on the meteor to save everyone. This had to be the dumbest plot point it showed up out of nowhere and was like some way to make the killer seem like a hero at the end and for them to both rest or some shi but it was dumb. It had its good parts and some ep were interesting though I thought the anime was strong up until like ep 5 then it was a mess and kinda trashy. so plot id give a 5/10   Art/Animation- This was made by Mappa so I wasn't expecting the animation to be trash and it wasn't it was good pretty decent though I didn't like their cgi at times it looked kinda awkward but they did better than most animes when it comes to 3D animation maybe Im being generous idk I didn't think it was terrible. I do think though they could've just stuck with 2D animation especially when they were flying or showing their machine parts these were the only times they were using 3D so having it at all was unnecessary and it made it looks ugly at times but decent. So I'd give it like a 7/10  Characters- They all pissed me off except for Inuyashiki and Ando everyone else in this anime were extremely dumb especially Hiro bro was so annoying as an MC bro was killing then helping then killing and he had prob the dumbest backstory, the police in Japan did nothing the entire series they just got killed and kept shooting hiro and was like " we keep shooting him why isn't he dying" or when they pronounced him dead but he had no blood or bullet wounds on him. Not to mention Inuyashikis family didn't really seem to care abt him until the end when they found out he was a superhero like if he never was I'm sure they wouldn't care if he died from his original cancer. I hated the characters they had nothing to attach or feel to them by the end of the series idec if the old man died bruh cause they forget abt him in like 2 scenes later and they did his daughter forgot all abt him once she found out she got on the jump magazine, I was hoping for her to atleast visit his grave and be like we did it and then run home nah she didn't care went on with her life and her whack ass brother still getting beat cause hes poor. Trash characters -100000000/10   Overall a 5/10 |6
Kono Danshi, Sekka ni Nayandemasu.|https://myanimelist.net/anime/25143/Kono_Danshi_Sekka_ni_Nayandemasu|DancingTheBa|https://myanimelist.net/profile/DancingTheBa|Recommended|                      Score: a big, fat, juicy, one out of ten.  This anime is extremely slow, like, grandma counting her dimes at the cash levels of slow. I also have a hard time even imagining that more than 1 in every 7 billion people have a crystal fetish, but here we are. I would only recommend this to someone who has already watched Sleeping With Hinako and wants a new terrible OVA to fall asleep to.  The not-so-beautiful bØys in this anime are just that, not beautiful. When you watch a yaoi, you want to see the handsome, succulent bØys in action, but they look like trash. The art                   ... is middle schoolers deviant art OC levels of ugly. Why are bØys faces so ugly? Why is everything so blurry? Why is there weird effects everywhere? Nobody knows. The two bØys in this OVA are the typical greasy old man and the shy, annoying (and under-aged) bØy that is the staple of every fucking yaoi in existence, because fuck making new characters, this is yaoi and we all want to see the same plot and characters in every single one of these abominations. It should also be noted that the """animation""" is terrible and makes me wish I was watching an unfinished student film project.  Now, besides the looks of the bØys, how do they fare in the soul department? We yaoi connoisseurs are not savages and realise that what's on the inside is what truly counts (LOL). The grizzly teacher man, also known as Onii-chan Sensei, is the rapist in this story. If you seen any yaoi before you know who the rapist is. But this yaoi is not like any other yaoi, because Onii-chan Sensei has a sad backstory where the women he liked dumped him ;O; . Now he's depressed and tells his students to kill themselves because he doesn't want them to be hurt by trusting another human being, so noble! He also has a crystal fetish because crystals won't betray them like the evil women ;O; . And the beautiful bØy who he comes to love turns into crystals for some reason! 100/10 character; lovable, relatable, and true!   For every scruffy yaoi man there is also the smooth, baby-faced bØy who gets groomed by him. In this story the MC spends about 100% of the runtime having self-deprecating monologues about how he has no friends and wants to die, which he hammers into everyones skulls about 90 times every scene. These scenes are extremely boring to watch and made me start thinking about how I wished he fully crystallized and died already. Every scene consists of him being depressing, getting some crystally bits on him, then the crystal disease going away for some reason and the scene ends. Repeat a lot. The end. I do not know why they decided to make this show about him turning into a crystal when being stressed, it just exists, and it's random.   Every yaoi needs to fufill their checklist of taboo and creepy requirements before they can be sent out to the public. I think in the lore of this they forgot to make it an incest story, so they fixed this by making the other bØy call him Onii-chan, which is weird. The teacher also says he'll wait for the bØy to grow up before getting into a relationship with him, which I thought was odd for a yaoi. Typically the younger the bØy is the more the scruffy pedo can't hold in his animal urges anymore and feasts upon them. The teacher is still a major douchebag though and I think there's a real solid reason for why he was dumped, I wonder what horribly toxic and terrible future our bØy has in store for him.  Normally I'd never recommend this dull and uninspired heap of animated garbage to anyone. But yaoi watchers have zero standards, so the worse something is the more they crave it. And I imagine only a yaoi hugger would ever come across this series, so I would 100% recommend this! |1
Kaichou wa Maid-sama!|https://myanimelist.net/anime/7054/Kaichou_wa_Maid-sama|nashyyyyyyy|https://myanimelist.net/profile/nashyyyyyyy|Recommended|                      This anime has really lovable characters in Misaki and Usui. Usui does some stuff that is literally impossible in real life like his hair and ability to pick up any girl with a snap of his finger but thats just anime I guess. Now first and foremost, the manga is a solid 9.5/10 great read. Now like many romcoms, this anime lacks in plot. But this anime in particular literally has little to no plot and every episode is misa-chan tackling problems within their world and Usui popping up to save and help her in the end while sexually harrassing her in the process (which                   ... she enjoyed A LOT quite clearly despite the tsundere outbursts). Usui gets no character development and the anime does not develop much of a plot until the last few episodes where a little more about Usui's character is revealed. In the manga, the relationship is far more developed and you can start to feel the love between the two. Misaki is still hella tsundere though and practically submits to Usui's every will because of her love. In both the anime and manga and I think both could have been better if she wasn't so spineless and had a backbone. Both characters are actually developed and you can see the vulnerable side of the otherwise gigachad op raid-boss MC that Usui is in the anime and it's actually quite heartwarming. The anime is far too slice-of-lifey with minimal romance plus zero plot and each episode has little-to no correlation with the previous or next episode unlike the arcs in the manga. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is pressed for time and wants action in every episode. Long story short, if they paced the anime faster(26 episodes of 33 chapters of the manga), stuck to the manga more in terms of dialogue, then they would have solved the plot issue and the usui issue. Maybe a little more romance and misaki not being so spineless and this woulda been a masterpiece. A season two which adapted the manga better would have been real nice. I rated this anime lower than my other ones because I am disappointed, it could have been, without a doubt, a bona-fide S tier romcom(although some people still think it is), if they stuck to the manga. Still a good anime but read the MANGA!!! Add or DM me with any questions! -nashy |7
A-Girl|https://myanimelist.net/anime/5447/A-Girl|fightclubs|https://myanimelist.net/profile/fightclubs|Mixed Feelings|                      Going into this anime, I expected your usual high school shoujo romance. I was completely wrong and immediately got hit with an experimental silent film. Like, legit. No dialogue, 0 voice acting, and title cards.   I almost gave up on this 6 minutes in due to a negative review, however, I pushed through and realized how charming it is. I wasn't exactly invested in it like I would be in a usual anime... if anything I was invested as if I was watching a music video with a good story. Which it actually could be categorized as. It reminds me of VIDEOCLUB's Amour Plastique.  Not everyone's                   ... going to like this but if you like cute and quirky romantic media, I would recommend this. It's an experience. |7
Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu|https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu|HoodieFans|https://myanimelist.net/profile/HoodieFans|Not Recommended|                      As someone who has read the source (dw no spoilers) - my main harp with this story and why I am disappointed is MC is a pedophile and it doesn't get any better. Also the character's are flat - maybe because he's a pedophile. This story would be much better as a fantasy instead of an isekai bc MC is 34 years old at birth and is a sexual predator which obviously has implications.   The author may claim that this is about redemption and self-improvement but it truthfully is wish fulfillment garbage. 'Pedophile wishes upon a star and gets granted the perfect scenarios to enact                   ... his pedophilic fantasy.' Not only is he reincarnated as a child so he can engage in sexual activity with other children, but he also is reincarnated into medieval times where it is encouraged for men to be rapists. The icing on the cake is that he retains his consciousness from before so we the viewer get to listen in on his disgusting plans to rape children and take advantage of them." Poor example of the author wanting cake and eating it too. DONT WORRY THOUGH - "if you ignore it, the story has a wonderful adventure and that aspect is only a small part of it". LMAO  You can't have self improvement and then pedophile raping children in the same sentence. Seems to me like author just wanted to be a creep and knew exactly how to sell generic isekai trash but make it spicy by having good animation and then ecchi and child molestation be okay because its under the pretense of MC is a POS and we aren't supposed to like him. I'm glad the fans which there are many of seem to vehemently support the anime as well as participating in crazy mental gymnastics to excuse MC's behavior and claim the author has wonderful writing abilities.   Another major gripe and why it is wish-fulfillment trash is none of the sexual shit has any sort of consequence. MC basically gets a pat on the back the equivalent of "Awww stop it. You shouldn't be touching girls like that." due to him looking like a child so the other characters assume he is a kid. He has all the agency in the world to do whatever fucked up shit he wants and he ends up crossing off all the lists. Woohoo. Maybe if there were consequences he would actually improve himself instead of trying (not really) to reach bare minimum of not raping children. (You can fantasize about it though) It also doesn't help that his father figure and role model is looked up to for being a rapist with a wife and a sidepiece. Yessir gotta be a pimp and a playa. I don't have a huge problem with that in anime. My problem is the MAIN CHARACTER (person we are supposed to sympathize with and is supposed to try to get better) is pimping children literally 8-12 yrs old as a 40+ yr old man? Mushoku Tensei world is literally a pedophile's playground. The guy is literally taking advantage of children and idc what your defense of that may be it is evident he is taking advantage of them because multiple times he is "testing the waters" when it comes to "how can I have sex with this child." Having a predator be the MC is just fucking disgusting.   It's a shame that this shit genuinely looked cool and I actually convinced myself to read all the source after watching the anime due to empty promises of MC gets better. This only made me hate the story more. Because guess what... the MC doesn't actually get better. This is beyond the sex aspect too which I'm sure is a dead horse right now that I am beating. He is a NEET that can't have relationships because he never went outside and he masturbates to his underage sister despite being 34 yrs of age. I will look over that for the purpose of "even pedophiles are redeemable" according to the author in an interview. I agree with him. So his social aspect sucks ass. How does Rudy fix it? He is handsome, smart, and born into nobility so he is respected by literally everyone as a prodigy. AKA he doesn't improve. Judging by how he sexually harasses the girls he just turns into more of a prick. I thought to myself surely when he feels the touch of a women since he's been craving it so much all this shit will get better. Nope, inner monologues constantly about sex and objectifying women. It even stays that way much later in the story in the LN. Like what man??? The MC is despicable throughout despite being promised he improves. Not only does MC not have any consequences for his actions but the side characters don't either.    0/10 - Shame the production quality was good. Also a shame that the isekai genre is so trash that people eat this shit up like its the best thing since sliced bread. The fact that people claim this is the best isekai either shows that:  1) Standards for isekai are shit or  2) Weebs are shit  Both seem to be the case as people adamantly support this frankly disgusting piece of shit work. But alas, if you can ignore MC's main flaw and the excessive pedophelia and rape in this story, it's a great anime. Cherry on top is the women in this anime also don't mean shit and are just used to satisfy and justify MC's lust.   It is just crazy to me that so many people can actually say this is the "Grandfather of Isekais" and quote based off of what I just read from someone's review "If you are tired of overused Isekai tropes then watch this because all of them originated from this."   Great! You are telling me if I'm tired of generic isekai let me watch the thing that has all the isekai tropes except worse. I don't see other isekai that has this much rape and pedophilia. Its just so wild to me that most viewers say "As long as you ignore the blatant pedophilia and mistreatment of women in this story, it is the best isekai ever". Like what? As long as I can ignore the MAIN CHARACTER and HALF OF THE CAST it's a great story? I guess it's no surprise that half of the cast is women because we gotta have enough women so that they can be objects for the powerful men in the story. Can't be having one female interest for each character because guess what it's the grandfather of isekai so we gotta have even the side character have harems.   And for the people that say that this is a masterpiece and you haven't seen anything like it/read anything like it... Sorry to break it to you but the writing is trash. If the story fails to even accomplish it's purpose mainly due to the fact that the author just HAS TO include pedophilia and rape (of children btw) the writing isn't good. In fact by sexualizing all the women, surprise surprise they end up becoming flat.   TLDR; The production quality is good. Worldbuilding good as well. However, that all means shit when a majority of the story is pedophilia and rape that is unexcused. This show has a shit load of controversy for a reason. If you have shitty taste this anime is perfect for you. I read all the source but I can't finish the anime. Contrary to what you may expect I love isekai trash bait. Ecchi isn't that bad (sometimes) and the characters don't even have to be realistic. HOWEVER, the problem with this anime is that it tries to be realistic and portray a good message and then slaps a shit ton of pedophilia and rape FROM THE MC HIMSELF.  If I could give this anime a 0/10 I would because it's actually disgusting. At least, Redo of Healer is very clearly revenge porn so its obviously over the top and unrealistic. This anime disguises itself (not even well for that matter) but well enough for it to be so popular and "critically acclaimed".   For isekai trash, the Grandfather of All Isekai surprisingly (not) crosses the line for me and is trash even I can't stomach. Stuff that has worse animation and more power tropes is more entertaining than this. But I guess the romance in this anime is amazingly portrayed if you ignore the grooming, rape, pedophilia, and mistreatment of women.  0/10 - + Good production quality. + World looks cool + Animation is good - Rape and pedophilia blatantly excused and prevalent - Characters are flat (Men abuse the women) (Women abused by men)  - Doesn't achieve the purpose it's set out to do. (Supposed to be redemption and self-improvement but turns out to be wish-fulfillment.   - Sexualization of children very prevalent - Writing is TRASH  Bonus: - Fans are trash too   This anime could truly have been great. Sadly MC has to be a 34 year old pedophile coming into the world. Not "refreshing" as some people claim but actually disgusting. I don't know if I'm more disgusted by the anime, or the fact that so many people are willing to defend it at all costs. Don't worry though its just fiction /s  End note; The reason this post seems like a hate rant is because it literally is. You know what's worse than producing this disgusting anime? Having it be widely praised for being amazing while the fans tell you to ignore the most egregious parts of the story. I am a hater and I don't hate any other anime. I believe that you should be able to watch what you want. My problem is the widespread popularity and disinformation surrounding the anime which I attribute to weebs being ignorant and despicable. I don't hate Redo of Healer (even though I think it's trash) because it does what its meant to do and no one believes it has amazing plot and w.e because it's comedic (in a fucked up way). I hate this anime because its literally disguises all the messed up shit and people are so quick to dismiss it. So not only do I hate the anime, I hate the people who are willfully ignorant but then voice their disgusting takes as well so they can support the author writing this trash. If it was a comedy I'd be fine with it, but this anime is supposed to instill a good lesson that anyone is redeemable even pedophiles but that obviously doesn't happen yet people claim that it does. Let's just normalize rape and pedophilia in isekais now because there is no backlash but instead praise. When you sexualize children its not wrong because its fiction, instead it sells even better bc whats better than lolis? Having grown fucking adults having sex and molesting those lolis under the disguise of children themselves. Modern animes truly bridge the gap of having lolis just think and like the characters but instead we get them even fucking the characters as well. Dream come true. Maybe the diehard fans can sympathize with the behavior because they are lolicons and somehow this shit is self-insert/pleasure/entertaining. Beats me.  IMPORTANT: Now if you read all of this or didn't (I don't blame you) the truly relevant stuff abt watching this series goes as follows:  If you think it will get better it does not. The sexualization gets worse and worse as the story goes on until S2 where it culminates into  something so disgusting you won't believe it. Now if that doesn't phase you and you are here to see a trashy isekai with garbage plot/writing, insane amounts and levels of ecchi (idek if pedophilia and rape constitutes as ecchi) [which is the problem btw that they treat these topics as ecchi and not PEDOPHILIA and RAPE], then this anime is for you. As mentioned previously, the animation is good and the story is immersive if you can ignore the sexual shit. Who knows, if you are fucked up like the rest of the weebs that like this shit you might even enjoy the romance that takes place between an adult and a child. Tread at your own risk or just fly straight through it and ask for S2 and S3. Up to you. |1
Naruto: Shippuuden|https://myanimelist.net/anime/1735/Naruto__Shippuuden|WazThatTL|https://myanimelist.net/profile/WazThatTL|Recommended|                      One of the most popular animes of all time..  Writing seems to have gotten better than its original series. The episodes where they showcase the past were probably the best episodes in the whole series other than the fights. The story was good but had bad pacing at times especially during the fights, some flaws, and also the sub par stories of some of the episodes because almost half of them were fillers. Character development was good also. The characters were alright, there are very few that are likable or interesting.  Some of the openings and endings of this anime are legendary and are definitely in the                   ... anime hall of fame. The music was amazing. Animation looked pretty good but quite inconsistent at times. It had a similar vibe to the previous series.  Overall it was an enjoyable series, it was well rounded and the only thing that really sticked out was the lore and history of this fictional world.  Memorable: No.. Rewatchable: Maybe.. |7
Arisa☆Good Luck|https://myanimelist.net/anime/16261/Arisa☆Good_Luck|Psychiezen|https://myanimelist.net/profile/Psychiezen|Recommended|                      While not something I expected to be grand, it was still quite enjoyable. A very nice bucket of water for any person who just wants to watch something silly/light-hearted after something intense. It's basic humor is surely entertaining for the one episode of the OVA it is. A little generic, but still, who doesn't like a little generic anime from time to time? Arisa's little shenanigans are basically what you'd expect from some cheesy slice-of-life anime, but the good part is that it is condensed into one small OVA. It is an older anime, and a more obscure one too. The animation definitely fits the                   ... time period it's from. Short & sweet. I enjoyed :) |7
